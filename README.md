## 🧠 Best Learning Approach: **Build Projects, Not Just Read Docs**

> 📌 **Learning by doing is the fastest way to grow as a developer.**  
> This repository follows a **project-based learning** approach — each concept is tied to a real-world application so you can see how it works in practice.

Instead of just reading theory, you'll build apps like:
- 🛒 E-commerce platforms
- 💬 Chat applications
- 📚 Bookstore websites
- 🏥 Hospital management systems
- 📈 Expense trackers

These projects help you:
- Understand how frontend and backend connect
- Practice debugging and deployment
- Build a portfolio that impresses recruiters
